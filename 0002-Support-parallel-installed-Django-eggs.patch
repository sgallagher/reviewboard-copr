Subject: [PATCH 2/4] Support parallel-installed Django eggs

If a system has different versions of Django installed as separate
eggs (such as having the latest version as well as an older version
for compatibility with ReviewBoard), this addition to the WSGI
loader enables it to find the matching supported version on the
system.

This will also make things easier on distro upgrades, as it will be
possible to have both the Django 1.4 egg on the system with Review
Board 1.7.21 and Django 1.6 in place for Review Board 2.0
