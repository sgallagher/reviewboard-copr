-     Authentication failures when setting up repositories are now more useful
-     Added our own SSH replacement for standardizing on behavior and working
-     around OpenSSH limitations
-     The Repository page in the administration UI now talks about API Tokens
-     and links to the GitHub Account page for Git repositories, making it
-     easier to set up a GitHub repository
- API Fixes
-     Fixed logging in on requests using HTTP Basic Auth
-     Fixed wrong responses when performing a request requiring authentication
-     as an anonymous user
-     Fixed anonymous access to the API when anonymous access is enabled
-     Fixed replies to screenshot comments in the new web API
-     Fixed removing screenshots from review requests

-     The API Token for GitHub repositories are now extracted properly in the
-     Repository page in the administration UI

* Mon Nov 22 2010 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.1-18
- New Features
-      Permission denied errors are shown when accessing unreachable local Git
-      repositories. (Bug #1765)
-      Previously, if a Git repository was used and there wasn’t sufficient
-      file permissions to access it, a vague error saying that the repository
-      was unreachable would appear. Now we check to find out if it’s a
-      permissions error, and display an appropriate error message.
- Performance Improvements
-      Reduce the number of SQL queries in the legacy JSON API.
-      Some of the legacy API handlers performed more queries than necessary.
-      We now perform fewer queries. Patch by Ben Hollis.
- Bug Fixes
-      Fixed several small problems in the Admin UI from bundling Django media
-      files.
-      For historical reasons, we’ve always shipped the Django Admin media
-      files as part of Review Board. This comes from a time before rb-site
-      existed, when we needed a single media directory with everything inside
-      it. However, it just introduces various compatibility problems these
-      days. We now make use of the media files that are installed with Django
-      Fixed a breakage in the diff viewer with SCons files. (Bug #1864)
-      Any SCons files put up for review would break the diff viewer, due to a
-      typo when looking up information on that type of file.
-      Added the Parent Diff field to the New Review Request page. (Bug #1651)
-      The Parent Diff field was missing for Git, Bazaar, and Mercurial,
-      making it impossible to upload a parent diff through the web UI when
-      creating a new review request.
-      Fixed some common installation problems with the generated
-      lighttpd.conf file. (Bug #1618, Bug #1639)
-      Several installs with lighttpd would give 404 Not Found errors, due to
-      some configuration problems in the sample config file.
-      Fixed support for multiple e-mail addresses assigned to a group.
-      (Bug #1661)
-      Multiple e-mail addresses for a group were supported, but broken in
-      1.5. We now split them out properly.
-      The screenshot area is no longer hidden immediately after uploading a
-      screenshot.
-      Fixed an error in the web API when serializing to XML.
-      Fixed broken intervals for search updating in the generated crontab
-      file.
-      The intervals would cause a full index to happen at every minute at 2AM
-      on Sundays, rather than only at 2AM.
-      Fixed an error when permanently deleting a review request.
-      The administrator-specific ability to permanently delete a review
-      request would succeed but generate an error page.
