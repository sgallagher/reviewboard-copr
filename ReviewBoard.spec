Review Board is a powerful web-based code review tool that offers
developers an easy way to handle code reviews. It scales well from small
projects to large companies and offers a variety of tools to take much
of the stress and time out of the code review process.

-     Local ID field
-   * Table captions in the admin dashboard were scrambled on Google Chrome
-   * Review Board no longer breaks when set up with mod_wsgi without
-     mod_python installed

-     request page. Previously, we’d show the original caption
-   * Editing a caption for a screenshot properly saves it again

-     maintain the order shown in the actual fields
-   * Fixed a usability problem with the user infobox
-   * Fixed visual issues in the user infobox on Google Chrome

- New upstream security release 1.5.7

     This affected the diff viewer and screenshot pages, and allowed a
     commenter to break the page and execute JavaScript

* Mon Aug 29 2011 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.6-2
- Fix python-pygments requirement
- ReviewBoard will work with python-pygments >= 1.1.1, but performance may
  be slower.

- New upstream release 1.5.6
- http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/dev/reviewboard/1.5.6/
- New Features:
-   The PATH environment variable is now shown in the error when patch.exe
    can't be found, in order to help figure out where it needs to go
-   rb-site more clearly informs that an existing database with valid
    permissions is needed for installation
-   rb-site now lists recommendations for different services, and lists
    options that aren’t officially supported
-   Tabs in the diff viewer are now marked up, allowing custom stylesheets to
    display them differently. By default, they don’t look any different
-   Added Fedora Hosted to the hosting provider options

    confirmation before discarding the new text

-   We now support storing lots of text in the Description and Testing Done
    fields on MySQL
- Performance Improvements:
-   Review Board now requires Pygments 1.4 or higher. Older installations
    running older versions of Pygments should get a performance increase when
    rendering diffs
- Bug Fixes:
-   Using Review Board with wsgi without mod_python installed on the system no
    longer prevents Review Board from breaking
-   Screenshot draft captions are now always displayed correctly. Previously,

    them to be seen when reloading the page
-   When sending an e-mail, we no longer crash if the sender has no e-mail
    address
-   Caching really long files or diffs now works more consistently.
    Previously, it was possible for the data to not be stored correctly
-   Fixed a date range calculation sometimes causing the log viewer to fail on
    the first of the month

    a proxy will no longer cause an HTTP 500 error to display

    in the administration UI no longer breaks review requests
-   The Mercurial support no longer overrides the SSH client configuration if
    one is already provided
-   The recaptcha_client dependency has been renamed to recaptcha-client. Both
    technically work, but the former is more correct and makes packaging
    easier
-   Fixed a few occasional errors that could show up on the dashboard under
    certain conditions

* Fri Jun 17 2011 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.5-2

* Mon Nov 22 2010 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.1-18
- New Features
-      Permission denied errors are shown when accessing unreachable local Git
-      repositories. (Bug #1765)
-      Previously, if a Git repository was used and there wasn’t sufficient
-      file permissions to access it, a vague error saying that the repository
-      was unreachable would appear. Now we check to find out if it’s a
-      permissions error, and display an appropriate error message.
- Performance Improvements
-      Reduce the number of SQL queries in the legacy JSON API.
-      Some of the legacy API handlers performed more queries than necessary.
-      We now perform fewer queries. Patch by Ben Hollis.
- Bug Fixes
-      Fixed several small problems in the Admin UI from bundling Django media
-      files.
-      For historical reasons, we’ve always shipped the Django Admin media
-      files as part of Review Board. This comes from a time before rb-site
-      existed, when we needed a single media directory with everything inside
-      it. However, it just introduces various compatibility problems these
-      days. We now make use of the media files that are installed with Django
-      Fixed a breakage in the diff viewer with SCons files. (Bug #1864)
-      Any SCons files put up for review would break the diff viewer, due to a
-      typo when looking up information on that type of file.
-      Added the Parent Diff field to the New Review Request page. (Bug #1651)
-      The Parent Diff field was missing for Git, Bazaar, and Mercurial,
-      making it impossible to upload a parent diff through the web UI when
-      creating a new review request.
-      Fixed some common installation problems with the generated
-      lighttpd.conf file. (Bug #1618, Bug #1639)
-      Several installs with lighttpd would give 404 Not Found errors, due to
-      some configuration problems in the sample config file.
-      Fixed support for multiple e-mail addresses assigned to a group.
-      (Bug #1661)
-      Multiple e-mail addresses for a group were supported, but broken in
-      1.5. We now split them out properly.
-      The screenshot area is no longer hidden immediately after uploading a
-      screenshot.
-      Fixed an error in the web API when serializing to XML.
-      Fixed broken intervals for search updating in the generated crontab
-      file.
-      The intervals would cause a full index to happen at every minute at 2AM
-      on Sundays, rather than only at 2AM.
-      Fixed an error when permanently deleting a review request.
-      The administrator-specific ability to permanently delete a review
-      request would succeed but generate an error page.
