- New upstream security release 1.7.14
- http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/reviewboard/1.7.14/
- Some API resources were accessible even if their parent resources were not,

    * Function names in diff headers are no longer rendered as HTML.

      as HTML, without escaping it. This was an XSS vulnerability.
    * The default Apache configuration is now more strict with how it serves up
      file attachments. This does not apply to existing installations. See
      http://support.beanbaginc.com/support/solutions/articles/110173-securing-file-attachments
      for details.
    * Uploaded files are now renamed to include a hash, preventing users from
      uploading malicious filenames, and making filenames unguessable.

      Google.

      requests on Python 2.7.x and Windows 7.
    * Review requests on Local Sites are now guaranteed to have the proper ID.
    * Fixed starring review requests on Local Sites.

      provides the URL to the snippet of the screenshot being commented on

      the text for any link pointing to the file. This may differ depending on
      the comment
    * Added a review_url field to file attachment comment resources, which
      provides the URL to the review page for the file
    * Added a thumbnail_html field to file attachment comment resources, which
      provides HTML for rendering the thumbnail of the portion of the file
      being rendered, if any
- UI Changes:
    * Improved the look and feel of the issue summary table. It’s cleaner and
      no longer looks odd with long comment text
- Bug Fixes:

      relative timestamps

-     request page. Previously, we’d show the original caption
-   * Editing a caption for a screenshot properly saves it again

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.7-1
- New upstream security release 1.5.7
- Security Fixes:
-    A script injection vulnerability was discovered in the commenting system.
     This affected the diff viewer and screenshot pages, and allowed a
     commenter to break the page and execute JavaScript

* Mon Aug 29 2011 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.6-2
- Fix python-pygments requirement
- ReviewBoard will work with python-pygments >= 1.1.1, but performance may
  be slower.

* Mon Aug 22 2011 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.6-1
- New upstream release 1.5.6
- http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/dev/reviewboard/1.5.6/
- New Features:
-   The PATH environment variable is now shown in the error when patch.exe
    can't be found, in order to help figure out where it needs to go
-   rb-site more clearly informs that an existing database with valid
    permissions is needed for installation
-   rb-site now lists recommendations for different services, and lists
    options that aren’t officially supported
-   Tabs in the diff viewer are now marked up, allowing custom stylesheets to
    display them differently. By default, they don’t look any different
-   Added Fedora Hosted to the hosting provider options
-   Editing a field and then canceling it on a review request now prompts for
    confirmation before discarding the new text
-   Control-S now saves the current text in review request fields
-   We now support storing lots of text in the Description and Testing Done
    fields on MySQL
- Performance Improvements:
-   Review Board now requires Pygments 1.4 or higher. Older installations
    running older versions of Pygments should get a performance increase when
    rendering diffs
- Bug Fixes:
-   Using Review Board with wsgi without mod_python installed on the system no
    longer prevents Review Board from breaking
-   Screenshot draft captions are now always displayed correctly. Previously,
    only the main caption would display, making them appear blank on new
    uploads
-   Changing screenshot draft captions now invalidates the cache, allowing
    them to be seen when reloading the page
-   When sending an e-mail, we no longer crash if the sender has no e-mail
    address
-   Caching really long files or diffs now works more consistently.
    Previously, it was possible for the data to not be stored correctly
-   Fixed a date range calculation sometimes causing the log viewer to fail on
    the first of the month
-   Failing to load the Review Board News feed in the administration UI due to
    a proxy will no longer cause an HTTP 500 error to display
-   Invalid bug tracker URLs (those containing more than one %%s, for example)
    in the administration UI no longer breaks review requests
-   The Mercurial support no longer overrides the SSH client configuration if
    one is already provided
-   The recaptcha_client dependency has been renamed to recaptcha-client. Both
    technically work, but the former is more correct and makes packaging
    easier
-   Fixed a few occasional errors that could show up on the dashboard under
    certain conditions

* Fri Jun 17 2011 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.5-2
- Resolves: rhbz#598463 - rb-site suggest that I use an unsafe temporary

- Better handle errors during syntax highlighting
- Optimize the starring feature in the dashboard. This simplifies the
- JavaScript and reduces the HTML file size
- rbssh now uses the current user’s username as a default when connecting to
- a repository. This doesn't really affect repository access in Review Board
- except under very specific circumstances, but is mostly for testing on the
- command line
- http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/dev/reviewboard/1.5.5/

* Mon Feb 21 2011 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.4-1

- Added API support for creating/updating/removing repositories
- Added API for change number-related updates
- Fix validation problems with the Search Index settings in the
- Administration UI

* Mon Nov 22 2010 Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com> - 1.5.1-18
- New Features
-      Permission denied errors are shown when accessing unreachable local Git
-      repositories. (Bug #1765)
-      Previously, if a Git repository was used and there wasn’t sufficient
-      file permissions to access it, a vague error saying that the repository
-      was unreachable would appear. Now we check to find out if it’s a
-      permissions error, and display an appropriate error message.
- Performance Improvements
-      Reduce the number of SQL queries in the legacy JSON API.
-      Some of the legacy API handlers performed more queries than necessary.
-      We now perform fewer queries. Patch by Ben Hollis.
- Bug Fixes
-      Fixed several small problems in the Admin UI from bundling Django media
-      files.
-      For historical reasons, we’ve always shipped the Django Admin media
-      files as part of Review Board. This comes from a time before rb-site
-      existed, when we needed a single media directory with everything inside
-      it. However, it just introduces various compatibility problems these
-      days. We now make use of the media files that are installed with Django
-      Fixed a breakage in the diff viewer with SCons files. (Bug #1864)
-      Any SCons files put up for review would break the diff viewer, due to a
-      typo when looking up information on that type of file.
-      Added the Parent Diff field to the New Review Request page. (Bug #1651)
-      The Parent Diff field was missing for Git, Bazaar, and Mercurial,
-      making it impossible to upload a parent diff through the web UI when
-      creating a new review request.
-      Fixed some common installation problems with the generated
-      lighttpd.conf file. (Bug #1618, Bug #1639)
-      Several installs with lighttpd would give 404 Not Found errors, due to
-      some configuration problems in the sample config file.
-      Fixed support for multiple e-mail addresses assigned to a group.
-      (Bug #1661)
-      Multiple e-mail addresses for a group were supported, but broken in
-      1.5. We now split them out properly.
-      The screenshot area is no longer hidden immediately after uploading a
-      screenshot.
-      Fixed an error in the web API when serializing to XML.
-      Fixed broken intervals for search updating in the generated crontab
-      file.
-      The intervals would cause a full index to happen at every minute at 2AM
-      on Sundays, rather than only at 2AM.
-      Fixed an error when permanently deleting a review request.
-      The administrator-specific ability to permanently delete a review
-      request would succeed but generate an error page.
